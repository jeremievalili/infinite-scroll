# INFINITE SCROLL , a unsplash API project

Hi! this is a infinite scroll of picture 

## Stacks 
Javascript, CSS , API Unsplash

## Description

I take 30 pictures with the unsplash API and put it into a array. 
With the Javascript I create HTML element and child them with the appendChild function 
In order to display it on the screen. 

The code can be improve and the CSS can be better with CSS GRID and animation. 
I could add a research function too in order to improve the user experience.
